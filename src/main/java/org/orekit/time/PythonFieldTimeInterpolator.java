     * Get an interpolated instance.
     * <p>
     * Note that the state of the current instance may not be used
     * in the interpolation process, only its type and non interpolable
     * fields are used (for example central attraction coefficient or
     * frame when interpolating orbits). The interpolable fields taken
     * into account are taken only from the states of the sample points.
     * So if the state of the instance must be used, the instance should
     * be included in the sample points.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Note that this method is designed for small samples only (say up
     * to about 10-20 points) so it can be implemented using polynomial
     * interpolation (typically Hermite interpolation). Using too much
     * points may induce <a
     * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%27s_phenomenon">Runge's
     * phenomenon</a> and numerical problems (including NaN appearing).
